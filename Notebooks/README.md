**Module Summary**
Statistical models are important in many applications. They contain two main elements: a set of parameters with information of scientific interest (eg the mean of a normal distribution, or the slope in a regression model) and an "error distribution" representing random variation.
This module lays the foundations for the analysis of such models.
The first part deals with suitable choices for the "error" term, in particular looking carefully at methods for analyzing continuous distributions. The second part focuses on the construction of appropriate statistical models and the development of methods to gain information about the unknown parameters. The main emphasis is on the use of likelihood methods. We shall use practical examples from a variety of statistical applications to illustrate the ideas.
